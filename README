A little guide to compile AOKP for Pyramid

All commands are done in the terminal

Requirements:
* Computer
* Common Sense
* Some Linux Experience
* Linux preferably with 64-bit Installed,
* At least 4GB of ram with a dual core processor.

Dependencies: sun java6, I presumes that you have it installed, if not do that first.

Required Software to Install:

For 32-bit and 64-bit System

Code:

$ git-core gnupg flex bison python rar original-awk gawk p7zip-full gperf libsdl1.2-dev libesd0-dev libwxgtk2.6-dev squashfs-tools build-essential zip curl libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev pngcrush schedtool

Only for 64-bit System

Code:

$ g++-multilib lib32z1-dev ia32-libs lib32ncurses5-dev lib32readline-gplv2-dev gcc-multilib g++-multilib

Other Required Software:

Code:

$ libc6-dev x11proto-core-dev libx11-dev libgl1-mesa-dev mingw32 tofrodos python-markdown libxml2-utils

Now to the source

Code:

$ mkdir -p ~/bin
$ mkdir -p ~/android/system
$ curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > ~/bin/repo
$ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo (Reboot is required after this)
$ repo init -u https://github.com/elelinux/platform_manifest.git -b jb-mr1
$ repo sync

This will take a while, boil some coffee and take it easy
when it´s finished let´s start to compile

$ . build/envsetup.sh
$ lunch "and choose pyramid"
$ make bacon "or if you want to compile little faster make -j8 bacon"
